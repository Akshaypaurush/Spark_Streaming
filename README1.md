# Twitter real time data Analysis using Spark_Streaming and Kafka

## Project Description
For This Big-data Project, we took Twitter API for Real-Time Data Processing from https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/stream-tweets-in-real-time.
Firstly we have to check that Zookeeper server is up and running ,and then check the Kafka server.
Using Apache Kafka first we Created a topic in Jupyter notebook and produce the topic to subscribers with the help of producer and consumers consumes that particular topic. 
Then we created the DStreams to store the real time Twitter Data and process that Data using Dstreams operations.
